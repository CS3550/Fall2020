# Topics in the interview questions

In class we talked about thinking about this course in one of two ways: three themes or a series of protocols. As the self-assessment part of the final, I will ask you how comfortable you would be answering the questions in the three broad themes. The question text will approximately be (note that we will cover TCP/IP after Thanksgiving):

How comfortable are you answering the interview questions about the three themes:
- The parallel nature of network communications.
  - This includes the questions about sockets, processes, threads, TCP/IP, and synchronization
- The security nature of network communications.
  - This includes the questions about cryptography, security, and cryptocurrency.
- The current infrastructure of network communications.
  - This includes HTTP, DHCP, DNS, NAT, default gateways, TCP/IP, etc.
